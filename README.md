Church Management System

This project was born out of a need to solve the problem of record-keeping and accepting donations in my local church. 

Noticing the church repeatedly asked us to write our details on paper, I came up with the idea and created a church management system with different roles for different users; Counselor, Pastorate and Administrator which would allow information of members to be readily available to authorized users on the go which would greatly improve follow up of members for couselors, accept donations online, verify donations, schedule events, accept payer request or suggestion etc.

This application performs the following tasks:
Portal for authrorsed  users, Stores members and workerâ€™s data details, Search for members, View and Make prayer requests, Make online donations, Contact form via email, Event scheduler for pastors, Verify online transactions, Export CSV. File of workers.
