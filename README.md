# Church Management System

## Overview

This project was born out of a need to solve the problem of record-keeping and accepting donations in my local church. 

Noticing the church repeatedly asked we write our details on paper, I came up with the idea and created a church management system with different roles for different users; **Counselor**, **Pastorate** and **Administrator** which would allow information of members to be readily available to authorized users on the go which would greatly improve follow up on members by the couselors, accept donations online, verify donations, schedule events, accept payer request or suggestion etc. This work was done using **HTML5, CSS, bootstrap, jquery and javaScript** for frontend, **PHP, MYSQL database** for backend and database.

### This application performs the following tasks:
- Portal for authrorsed  users
- Stores members and workerâ€™s data details
- Search for members
- View and Make prayer requests
- Make online donations useing paystack 
- Contact form via email
- Event scheduler for pastors
- Verify online transactions,
- Export workers details to CSV. file
